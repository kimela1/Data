### Plot Practice
Practice creating line graphs of global gas price data over time. Added titles, x & y axis labels, and scaled the graphs.  Customized the style and size of the charts. Looked at the FIFA 19 player data to create a histogram, pie charts, and a box and whisker plot.

* Analyzed 12 months of sales data using Python Pandas and Matplotlib.
* Combined 12 months of CSV files into a single file
* Cleaned up data (drop rows with NaN, convert to correct data types)
* Added additional columns to help understand the data
