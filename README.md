# Python Pandas Data Analysis

## Sales Analysis
### What did I do with the data?
* Analyzed 12 months of sales data using Python Pandas and Matplotlib.
* Combined 12 months of CSV files into a single file
* Cleaned up data (drop rows with NaN, convert to correct data types)
* Added additional columns to help understand the data

### Questions I answered by analyzing the data
* Which month had the most sales? How much was earned that month?
* Which city had the highest number of sales?
* What is the best time to display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying product?
* Which products are most often sold together?
* Which products sold the most?
* Is there a correlation between a product's price and the quantity ordered?
