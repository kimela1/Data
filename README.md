# Python Pandas Data 

## Hubway Database Analysis
Database from the bike-sharing service Hubway (data on over 1.5 million trips made with the service). Used Python to run SQL code to make it easier to display results.

### Analysis
* What was the duration of the longest trip?
* How many trips were taken by 'registered' users?
* What was the average trip duration?
* Do registered or casual users take longer trips?
* Which bike was used for the most trips?
* What is the average duration of trips by users over the age of 30?
* Which station is the most frequent starting point?
* Which stations are most frequently used for round trips?
* How many trips start and end in different municipalities?
* How many trips incurred additional fees (lasted longer than 30 minutes)?
* Which bike was used for the longest total time?
* Did registered or casual users take more round trips?
* Which municipality had the longest average duration?


## Sales Dataset Analysis
### What did I do with the data?
* Analyzed 12 months of sales data using Python Pandas and Matplotlib.
* Combined 12 months of CSV files into a single file
* Cleaned up data (drop rows with NaN, convert to correct data types)
* Added additional columns to help understand the data

### Analysis
* Which month had the most sales? How much was earned that month?
* Which city had the highest number of sales?
* What is the best time to display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying product?
* Which products are most often sold together?
* Which products sold the most?
* Is there a correlation between a product's price and the quantity ordered?
